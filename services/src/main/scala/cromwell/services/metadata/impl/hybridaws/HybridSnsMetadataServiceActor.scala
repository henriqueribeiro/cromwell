/**
  * A metadata service implementation which will function as a standard metadata service but also push all metadata
  * events to AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service). This class closely follows the pattern established in the
  * HybridPubSubMetadataServiceActor
  *
  * Under the hood it maintains its own MetadataServiceActor and AwsSnsMetadataServiceActor. All messages are routed
  * to the MetadataServiceActor. PutMetadataActions are also sent to the AwsSnsMetadataServiceActor. PutMetadataActionAndRespond
  * messages will be sent to the SnsMetadataServiceActor as a standard PutMetadataAction, i.e. only the standard
  * metadata service will be ACKing the request.
  *
  * To use this actor something similar to the following should be present in the cromwell.conf file:
  * <pre>
  * services {
  *   MetadataService {
  *     class="cromwell.services.metadata.impl.sns.HybridSnsMetadataServiceActor"
  *     config {
  *       aws {
  *         application-name = "cromwell"
  *         auths = [{
  *           name = "default"
  *           scheme = "default"
  *         }]
  *         region = "us-east-1"
  *         topicArn = "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:1111111111111:cromwell-metadata"
  *       }
  *     }
  *   }
  * }
  * </pre>
  *
  * @see cromwell.services.metadata.impl.sns.AwsSnsMetadataServiceActor
